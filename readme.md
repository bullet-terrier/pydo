# py_ado
mechanism to create abstract data models in python
to imitate the ado data entity models used in .NET

The main goal is to facilitate data storagte and 
use in a wider variety of environments, and under
various conditions.

This module will become a framework rather than
a program - so approach any updates as such.


Thanks,
